# 위키 번역

이 위키는 가능한 한 널리 접근할 수 있도록 하기 위해 crowdin: https\://crwd.in/lethal-company-modding-wiki 을 통해 번역을 합니다.

:::danger
_자동 번역본을 제출하지 말아주세요._\* ChatGPT, 구글 번역기 또는 이와 유사한 기계번역을 사용하는 번역은 거부 될 것입니다.

## 팁들

:::tip
**Crowdin의 "전체 번역" 기능을 사용하는 것은 권장하지 않습니다**, 원하시는 번역파일을 택하신 후 각 파일을 번역해주세요. 이런 식으로 더 많은 맥락을 얻을 수 있습니다.

만약 처음으로 편집기를 실행하셨다면 Crowdin's 만의 팁을 읽어주세요!

If the site/program does not have native translation support, please _do not translate the names of English buttons/menus_. The following programs/sites are not currently translated:

- r2modman
- Thunderstore

If you're not sure if a site/program has native translation, try it yourself or [start a discussion](#questions-and-new-languages)

### Links and parameters

Anything you see highlighted (or any other weird-looking text) are usually links or parameters.

Links are usually `<0>`, `<1>`, etc, and there's an opening and closing link. You **must** include anything that's highlighted in your translation. Example:

### Previous translations

Because this wiki is partially based on a [previously translated wiki](https://trombone.wiki), sometimes crowdin will show you similar existing translations.

Feel free to use these to your advantage, or start from scratch if you think you could improve upon it.

## Page translation order

The pages we recommend prioritizing, in order, are as follows:

- The main landing page (introduction.md)
- The sidebar (sidebar.md)
- Windows modding tutorial (installing-r2modman.md)
- Linux modding tutorial (installing-r2modman-linux.md)
- Frequently Asked Questions (faq.md)
- Info about the wiki (about.md)
- Everything else (mod development tutorials, this translation page, etc)

## Questions and new languages

If you have any questions about translation or would like a new language added to Crowdin, feel free to:

- [Create a discussion on Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/project/lethal-company-modding-wiki/discussions)
- [Make a GitHub issue](https://github.com/LethalCompany/ModdingWiki/issues)

### Enabling a translation

Once a translation is moderately complete, it needs to actually be added to the wiki so people can use it.

If a translation you're working on is moderately complete, contact the wiki maintainers through the above methods to get it added.

Not every single page needs to be finished, but you should ideally have translated at least:

- introduction.md
- sidebar.md
- any pages related to _installing_ mods
