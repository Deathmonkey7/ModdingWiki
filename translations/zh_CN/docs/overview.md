## 制作模组

::: tip
If you can't code and want to create a mod that does one common, simple thing (such as adding a suit or sound replacement) make sure to check the [Asset Modding APIs](/dev/apis/overview#asset-apis) section!

Many common use cases already have APIs that allow you to easily add content without using any code.
:::

If you're interested in trying to create your own mod for Lethal Company, you can find articles and tutorials in the [Developer's Guide](/dev/overview).

Once you're set up, make sure to check the [Modding APIs](/dev/apis/overview) section to see if there's any libraries that would make creating your mod easier.
