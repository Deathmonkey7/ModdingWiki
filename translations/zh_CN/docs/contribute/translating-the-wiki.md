# 翻译维基

为了让更多人能够为翻译做出贡献，本维基的翻译工作将使用Crowdin（https\://crwd.in/lethal-company-modding-wiki）进行

:::danger
**请不要提交机翻的内容**，仅使用例如ChatGPT，谷歌翻译，或者其他类似的翻译软件的翻译将不会被使用。
:::

## 建议

:::tip
**我们不推荐使用Crodwin网站的翻译全部（translate all）功能**，你可以直接点击你想要翻译的文件进行翻译。 You get more context this way.
:::

The first time you launch the editor you will see Crowdin's own tips, please read them!

If the site/program does not have native translation support, please _do not translate the names of English buttons/menus_. The following programs/sites are not currently translated:

- r2modman
- Thunderstore

If you're not sure if a site/program has native translation, try it yourself or [start a discussion](#questions-and-new-languages)

### Links and parameters

Anything you see highlighted (or any other weird-looking text) are usually links or parameters.

Links are usually `<0>`, `<1>`, etc, and there's an opening and closing link. You **must** include anything that's highlighted in your translation. Example:

![Example of proper translation, with links and formatting the same as the source material](/images/translating-the-wiki/dutchformattingexample.png)

### Previous translations

Because this wiki is partially based on a [previously translated wiki](https://trombone.wiki), sometimes crowdin will show you similar existing translations.

Feel free to use these to your advantage, or start from scratch if you think you could improve upon it.

## Page translation order

The pages we recommend prioritizing, in order, are as follows:

- The main landing page (introduction.md)
- The sidebar (sidebar.md)
- Windows modding tutorial (installing-r2modman.md)
- Linux modding tutorial (installing-r2modman-linux.md)
- Frequently Asked Questions (faq.md)
- Info about the wiki (about.md)
- Everything else (mod development tutorials, this translation page, etc)

## Questions and new languages

If you have any questions about translation or would like a new language added to Crowdin, feel free to:

- [Create a discussion on Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/project/lethal-company-modding-wiki/discussions)
- [Make a GitHub issue](https://github.com/LethalCompany/ModdingWiki/issues)

### Enabling a translation

Once a translation is moderately complete, it needs to actually be added to the wiki so people can use it.

If a translation you're working on is moderately complete, contact the wiki maintainers through the above methods to get it added.

Not every single page needs to be finished, but you should ideally have translated at least:

- introduction.md
- sidebar.md
- any pages related to _installing_ mods
